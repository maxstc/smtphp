This our SMTP honeypot.

If you would like to add your IP the wall of shame, send us some SMTP traffic.

If you would like to remove your IP from the wall of shame, you should have not sent us SMTP traffic. (haha)

Enjoy

todo: check that sender failed SPF/DKIM (or is trying to spoof as US!!!)
sort results by timestamp & only send a couple at a time
rate limiter
web scraping checker o_O
